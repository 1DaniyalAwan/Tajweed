                    <h2>What is Tajweed?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tajweed, derived from the Arabic root word 'j-w-d' meaning to make better or perfect, refers to the proficiency and art of correctly pronouncing, articulating, and intoning Arabic letters and words during the recitation of the Quran. It is not only a linguistic concept but an essential aspect of the art and science of Quran recitation, aimed at preserving the correct recitation over time. Tajweed is significant not only for its role in ensuring the accurate recitation of the Quran but also for the spiritual benefits it imparts. The word itself linguistically signifies 'proficiency' or 'doing something well,' emphasizing the importance of achieving excellence in Quranic recitation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The concept of Tajweed entails giving each letter of the Qur'an its due rights and characteristics during recitation, adhering to specific rules applicable to these letters in various situations. It involves recognizing both the essential and occasional characteristics of each letter. The Qur'an was initially revealed with Tajweed rules, as demonstrated by the angel Jibreel when reciting Allah's words to Prophet Muhammad. Observing these rules is imperative to recite the Qur'an as it was revealed.

                        "Tajweed Rules" encompass linguistic and pronunciation guidelines essential for accurately reciting the Quran, aligning one's recitation with the way Prophet Muhammad recited it. Given the sensitivity of the Arabic language, even a slight mispronunciation can alter meanings significantly. Learning Tajweed serves as a protective measure against mistakes, ensuring satisfaction in the recitation of the Qur'an, as emphasized in the verse: "…and recite the Quran with measured recitation" (Quran 73:4).</p> 
                        <br>
                        <h2>Importance and benefits of reading Quran with tajweed</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Tajweed ensures the accurate interpretation of Quranic verses, promoting a deeper understanding of the sacred text.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Reciting with Tajweed earns abundant rewards, with 10 rewards per letter, and the reciter gains the company of noble and obedient angels.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Following Tajweed guidelines preserves the Quran's original form, maintaining its constancy and preventing modification over time.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Accurate Quranic recitation is considered an act of worship, and Tajweed provides a systematic approach to ensure precise pronunciation and repetition of words.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Tajweed is a crucial component of Islamic education, providing a comprehensive understanding of Arabic phonetics and grammar, fostering language skills applicable to various academic fields.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Reciting the Quran with Tajweed is a demonstration of respect for its sacred nature, upholding its integrity and showcasing dedication to preserving its sanctity.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>The Purpose of Tajweed</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Qur'an, considered the word of Allah, is revered, and its every syllable is believed to be divine. The Science of Tajweed is a discipline aimed at making the recitation of the Qur'an accurate and proficient. It focuses on correct pronunciation, adhering to specific rules and characteristics for each letter without deviation. The ultimate goal is for the reciter to follow the way of the Prophet (PBUH) in reciting the Qur'an, as it was transmitted through Jibreel from Allah in the Classical Arabic dialect in which it was revealed.</p>
                       <br>
                        <P>Arabic letters each have a Makhraj – an exit or articulation point – in the mouth or throat from which they originate and they also each have Sifaat – attributes, or characteristics – particular to them. Knowing the Makhraj and Sifaat of each letter is an important part of Tajweed. Sometimes two letters have very similar exits which makes mixing them up easy. So if a person does not know the attributes of each letter there is a danger that he will change the meaning of the words in Qur’an recitation. Observing the rules of Tajweed in reciting protects the reciter from making mistakes in reciting the Qur’an.

                        <h2>Reasons For Setting Tajweed Rules</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Tajweed rules ensure error-free Quran recitation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Thorough practice of start, stop, and pause signs ensures accurate interpretation of Quranic verses.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Knowledge of Tajweed rules is crucial as the Quran includes signs that affect recitation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Rules categorize letters based on tongue touch and throat location, aiding in understanding individual and combined letter sounds.</p>

                        <h2>Mistakes in Tajweed</h2>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Clear Mistakes</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Must be avoided by knowing Tajweed rules.</p>
                        <p>Falling into clear mistakes is considered a sin.</p>
                        <p>Ibn Taymiyyah discourages praying behind someone making clear mistakes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Unobvious (Hidden) Mistakes</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The ruling on unobvious mistakes is lighter.</p>
                        <p>Recitation with unobvious mistakes is considered lacking in completeness.</p>
                        <p>Prayer behind someone with unobvious mistakes is considered sound.</p>
                        <br>
