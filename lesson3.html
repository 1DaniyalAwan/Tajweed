                    <h2>Articulation: مخرج</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>In Arabic, this point of articulation is termed ‘makhraj’ (مَخْرَج), with its plural being ‘makharij’مَخَارِج</p>
                    <p>The term stems from the Arabic root خَرجَ, translating to “he exited.”</p>
                    <p>There are 17 makharij.</p>

                    <h3>Principal Articulation Points of Arabic Letters</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The 17 makhârij can be categorized into five primary phonation locations:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>1.The oral cavity (or inner space of the mouth) – الجَوف: For these letters, there isn’t a specific point of origin; rather, the location is approximated.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The other four distinct articulation points (makharij) are:</p>
                <br><p>2.The throat – الحَلْق</p>
                <p>3.The tongue – اللِّسان</p>
                <p>4.The lips – الشَّفَتان</p>
                <p>5.The nasal passage – الخَيْشُوم</p>
                <br><h3>1. The oral cavity - الجَوف</h3>
                <br><p>Al Jawf – الجَوف: Refers to the oral cavity or inner space of the mouth. From this region emanate the elongation letters, namely:</p>
                <p>The ا, producing the sound “a” when it has a sukoon and is preceded by a fatha.</p>
                <p>The و, producing the sound “oo” when it has a sukoon and is preceded by a damma.</p>
                <p>The ي, producing the sound “ee” when it has a sukoon and is preceded by a kasra.</p>
                <p>These letters are highlighted in the Holy Qur’an in the following verse segment:</p>
                <p>تِلْكَ مِنْ أَنبَاءِ الْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَا إِلَيْكَ</p>
                <p>That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you (11:49)</p>
                <p>The letters emanating from the al jawf (inner space of the mouth) are unrestricted in their pronunciation, with the sound ceasing only when one’s breath runs out.</p>
                <p>The exact articulation point for these letters is more generalized rather than specific, as they rely heavily on airflow.</p>
                <p>They are also referred to as al huruf al hawa’iyya – الحُرُوفُ الهَوَائِيَّة, which alludes to their airy nature.</p>
                <p>Note: It’s crucial to remember that these three letters (alif ا, wâw و, and yâ ي) should exclusively be pronounced from the mouth; the nasal passage doesn’t play a role in their articulation.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Al Jawf (The empty space in the mouth and throat)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The empty space in the mouth and throat is a major area and an articulation point at the same time. The three Madd (lengthened) letters originate from this general area, and these letters are:</p>
                <p>Waw (و) Sakinah preceded by a Dhammah</p>
                <p>Yaa (ي) Sakinah preceded by a Kasrah</p>
                <p>Alif (أ) preceded by a Fathah</p>
                <br>
                <h3>2. The throat - الحَلْق</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The throat includes 3 exit points:</p>
                <p>أَقْصَى الحَلْق –aqsâ al-halq: the back of the throat</p>
                <p>َسَطُ الحَلْق – wasat al-halq: the middle of the throat</p>
                <p>َدْنَى الحَلْق –adnâ al-halq: the entrance to the throat.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>A. Aqsa al-halq - أَقْصَى الحَلْق: The innermost part or the entrance of the throat</h3>
                <br><p>This area corresponds to the region around the larynx. From this location, two letters are articulated: the hamza ء and the hâ.</p>
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّـهُ أَحَدٌ</p>
                <p>Say, “He is Allah, [who is] One</p><br>
                <h3>B. وَسَطُ الحَلْق -wasat al-halq : the middle of the throat</h3>
                <br><p>This area is situated at the pharynx, near the glottis. The letters ‘ayn ع and Hâ ح are articulated from this location.</p>
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <p>إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p>
                <p>It is You we worship, and You we ask for help. (1:5)</p>
                <p>بِسْمِ اللَّـهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>
                <p>In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>C. أَدْنَى الحَلْق -  adnâ al-halq: the entrance to the throat</h3>
                <br>
                <p>This section is nearer to the mouth. The letters ghayn غ and khâ خ originate from this point.</p>
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <p>صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</p>
                <p>The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favour, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. (1:7)</p>
                <p>َهُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</p>
                <p>and they will abide therein eternally. (2:25)</p>
                <p>Note: The letters غ and خ require emphasis, as they are strong letters. This entails a fuller mouth resonance when pronouncing them.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The Throat</h3>
                <br><p>The throat’s farthest point and its distance from the chest( ء/ ه)</p>
                <p>The middle of the throat (ع/ح)</p>
                <p>The lowest part of the throat (غ/خ)</p>
