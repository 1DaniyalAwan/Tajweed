                    <h2>What is Tanween?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The change made by Tanween on the word is called “nunation”. Tanween signs add an “n” sound to the end of a word in certain circumstances. Tanween is when there are double Fatha (Nasb) the two lines above the word, double Kasra (Jar )the two lines under the word, and  Dhamma (Raf). If Tanween is attached to the next letter, it is read, if it is paused on Tanween, it is not read. The stances of tanween in the word are as follows</p>

                    <h3>Thing to Remember</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>When a pause is made after the word which has Tanween Al-Fatha in the ending, Tanween is turned into an Alif and stopped by lengthening an amount of Alif .</p>
                    <p>There will be no Alif if in Tanween Al-Fath if the last letter of the word is a Taa Marbutah (ة)ز</p>
