                    <h3>3. The tongue- اللِّسان</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The tongue comprises 10 distinct articulation points, giving rise to 18 letters:</p>
                    <p>The farthest part of the tongue (aqsâ al-lisan) against the pharynx and upper palate is the articulation point for the letter qâf ق.</p>
                    <p>Just below the qâf’s articulation point, where the upper part of the tongue meets the upper palate, is where the kâf ك emerges. The letter qâf ق is positioned nearer to the throat.</p>
                    <p>The middle of the tongue (wast al-lisan) meeting the upper palate produces the letters djîm ج, shîn ش, and yâ ي (when yâ acts as a consonant, not a long vowel). Remember to pronounce ج as “djîm,” not “jîm.”</p>
                    <p>The side (or sides) of the tongue pressing against the upper premolars and molars articulates the unique dâd ض. Arabic is often referred to as “the language of ض” since this letter is exclusive to Arabic and among the most challenging to pronounce.</p>
                    <p>One edge of the tongue’s tip against the palatal mucosa provides the pronunciation for the letter lâm ل.</p>
                    <p>Slightly above the position for lâm, where the tongue’s tip presses the palatal mucosa, is the point for the noûn ن.</p>
                    <p>Just below the noûn’s point, where the tip pushes against the palatal mucosa while also causing the tongue’s rear to vibrate, is where the râ ر is articulated.</p>
                    <p>The tongue’s tip against the palatal mucosa of the upper central incisors articulates the letters ta ت, dâ د, and Tâ ط.</p>
                    <p>The tip, combined with the part separating the lower central incisors, shapes the sounds for sâd ص, shîn ش, and zey ز.</p>
                    <p>By resting the tip of the tongue against the tip of the upper central incisors and slightly protruding it between the teeth, the letters Zâ ظ, dhâl ذ, and thâ ث are pronounced.</p>
                    <br><h3>The Tongue</h3><br>
                    <p>The deepest part (ق)</p>
                    <p>The deepest part and what lies opposite (ك)</p>
                    <p>The middle part (ج/ش/ي) -Not the Madd ي-</p>
                    <p>The tip of the tongue (ض/ل)</p>
                    <p>The lower of the tip (ل)</p>
                    <p>The top side of the tip of the tongue and the gums of the front two upper incisions (ت/د/ط/ر)</p>
                    <p>The tip of the tongue and the gums of the front upper incisors (ن)</p>
                    <p>The tip of the tongue and the edge of the front 2 lower incisors (س/ز/ص)</p>
                    <p>The tip of the tongue and the bottom edge of the front 2 upper incisors (ظ /ذ /ث)</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>4. The lips - الشَّفَتان</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The lips serve as the articulation points for two makharij:</p>
                    <p>The inner part of the lower lip pressing against the upper central incisors creates the sound for the letter fâ ف.</p>
                    <p>The space between the lips forms the sounds for the letters wâw و (when acting as a consonant and not a long vowel), ba ب, and meem م.</p>
                    <p>The role of the lips in pronunciation is crucial, extending beyond the above-mentioned letters. Overlooking the position of the lips can result in mispronunciation.</p>
                    <p>For instance, while articulating the kasra, it’s essential to elongate the mouth horizontally (akin to a smile) to produce a clear “i” sound that doesn’t resemble an “è.” Proper articulation is key.</p>
                    <br><h3>The Lips</h3><br>
                    <p>The bottom edge of the front two upper incisors (ف)</p>
                    <p>Both lips (و/م/ب)</p>
                    <br><h3>5. The nasal cavity - الخَيْشُوم</h3><br>
                    <p>The nasal cavity plays a role in producing what’s known as the nasal resonance or ghunna (الغُنّة). This characteristic sound is particularly evident when pronouncing the letters noon ن and meem م when they have a shadda (ّ) over them. The ghunna is also present when the noon ن, meem م, or tanween is in a state of sukoon, but this occurs under specific conditions.</p>
