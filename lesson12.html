                    <p>Every language is distinct in its form and structure with some definite rules and instructions of its usage. These conditions and guidelines define the correct mode of communication of any lingo in reading, writing and speaking. Although forms of speech all over the world differ in many respects due to their restrictedness to specific regions, but all of them share common grammatical guidelines of taking breaks in between sentences.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Divine Language of the Holy Quran has its own principles which every reader has to take care about while reciting this Highly Revered Scripture. Since, it is easy to understand the longer conversation by dividing it into shorter fragments that is why the Quranic clauses are gapped with some necessary stop and pause signs so that the reader could comprehend its meaning in the rightful manner, learn to recite Quran with correct Tajweed (pronunciation) as well as in rhythmic and phonetic style. The “Waqf” means “stop” in the Arabic language.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>O – The Conclusion of Verse</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>“Waqf e Taam” represents the finishing end of a specific verse of Furqan e Hameed. It is also known as the “Perfect Stop”. It is represented simply by a circle at the conclusion of a Quranic line. The reciter has to stop here and take a breath before continuing reading further. It also shows the complete deliverance of the message in that sentence, so a narrator should look back at the verse, fully grasp its gist and get ready to learn about the following lines.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>مـ – The Compulsory Stop</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The sign of “Waqf e Laazim” bounds the reader to stop reading at this point, as the word laazim means imperative or to do at any cost. It is so because if one does not take a pause here, the entire meaning of the sentence will alter radically.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>ط –  The Absolute Pause</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>“Waqf e Mutlaq” is stop sign to indicate to the reader to take a gap in reciting the long passage by taking breath and discontinue the recitation for an instantaneous period of time. It is better to stop here because it makes the reading process easier by fully grabbing the meaning of already read text.</p>

                    <h2>ج –  The Permissible Stop</h2>

                    <p>“Waqf e Jaaiz” points toward completion of matter discussed in that fragment of the Ayah, so one needs to stop here, although it is not obligatory to do so, so that it can absorb the meaning discussed in previous part, and get ready to know about new matter in the following part of same verse.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>ز  –  Continue Reading</h2>

                    <p>“Qeela ‘Alayhil-Waqf” is a sign that shows not to stop recitation although there are differing opinions on whether to stop reading the verses or not.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>لا – No Need of Stopping</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>One should not discontinue reading the verses at this sign of “Laa” as it would change the meaning of Quranic lines altogether, yet one can stop when it is used at the end of the Ayah with Circle Mark of conclusion.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>ك – Similar Meaning as Previous Sign</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>“Kadhaalik or “like that” applies the same connotation of action as suggested by the preceding symbol.</p>
