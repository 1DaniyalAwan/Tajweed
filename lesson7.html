                    <h2>Definition Of Madd</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tajweed rules Madd can be better understood in light of its linguistic meaning, which is to increase or lengthen.</p>
                    <p>Madd in Tajweed refers to the stretching or extension of sounds of one of the 3 Madd letters.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Huroof e Maddah</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Madd means to stretch a sound and there are 3 Madd letters which are ا – و – ي .</p>
                    <p>When there is a Damma before wow sakin we stretach it for two counts and it is called wow Madd. When there is a Fatha before alif we stretch it for two counts and it is called Alif Madd.</p>
                    <p>نو حیھا۔ یقولون۔  الناس</p>
                    <p>Stretch for 2 counts</p>

                    <h3>Types of Madd in Tajweed</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are two different types of Madd:</p>
                    <p>1.Madd Asli/Tabi’y or Natural Madd</p>
                    <p>2.Madd Far’ee or Secondary Madd</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Secondary Madd (Madd Far’ee)</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Meanwhile, Secondary Madd or Madd Far’ee is the elongation of vowels but it is dependent on the presence of Hamza or Sukoon</p>
                    <p>We have multiple types of MADDAT that come under MADDE FAR’EEمد فرعی</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Madd ‘Ared Li- Ssukoon</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Madd A’red Li- Sskoon is one of the types of madd that can be defined as “temporary Madd for stopping”. If the Maad Tabee’ee (Natural Maad in the letters ا or و or ي) is followed by a letter at the end of a word, which has been made sakin temporary because the reader has to stop at the word, the reader should prolong the Madd Tabee’ee to be Madd ‘Ared Li Ssukoon.</p>
                    <p>Maad A’red Li Ssukoon is prolonged for 2, 4, or 6 beats.</p>
                    <p>(Note: Madd A’red Li- Sskoon only exists if the reader stops on that word. If the reader doesn’t stop on it, it should be considered as a Madd Tabee’ee ‘Natural Madd’ 2 beats).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Examples of Madd ‘Ared Li- Ssukoon</p>

                    <br><h4>When should we apply this Madd?</h4>
                    <p>We apply the Madd Al- Leen If one of these Leen letters is followed by a letter at the end of a word, which has been sakin due to stoppage.</p>
                    <p>The reader, in this case, should prolong the Leen letter. He can prolong it by 2, 4, or 6 beats.</p>
